# Resource IDs

The zpools.io REST API uses **readable, hyphenated IDs** for resources. This format is the same across the API and all clients (CLI, SDK, etc.).

## Format

Resource IDs are **four English words separated by hyphens**, for example:

- `substance-opposite-advertising-bug` (job ID)
- `law-hotel-shape-community` (zpool ID)
- `aware-administration-was-generally` (SSH pubkey ID)

They are generated by the server and returned in API responses. You use them in later requests (e.g. get job, delete zpool, delete SSH key).

## Where IDs appear

| Resource   | ID field    | Example use                          |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Job       | `job_id`    | Poll status, view history             |
| Zpool     | `zpool_id`  | Delete, modify, scrub, expand        |
| SSH key   | `pubkey_id` | Delete key; list shows ID per key    |
| PAT       | `key_id`    | Revoke token                         |

IDs are stable: the same resource keeps the same ID. For SSH keys, the same public key content always yields the same `pubkey_id`.

## Language and clients

This structure is defined by the REST API. The CLI and SDK expose these IDs as returned; they do not transform them. Documentation that refers to “job ID”, “zpool ID”, “key ID”, or “pubkey ID” means this hyphenated format unless stated otherwise.
